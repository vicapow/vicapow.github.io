## [What Do I Want?](/posts/what-do-i-want.html)
January 2, 2013

A while ago I was asked the question "what do you want?" it took me back. It wasn't something I really thought of much. So I took the time to write a few things down and a few days ago I came across that text file. here it is bellow:

* I want to be in control of what I decide to work on.

* I want to be take pride in the quality of the things I make.

* I want to make things people not only use, but fall in love with.

* I want there to be a direct correlation between the quality of my work and how much money I make.

glad to see my opinions haven't changed :)
